## Introduction

A manufacturing plant has parts delivered on a conveyor belt to be later assembled. The manufacturer aims to implement a system that can identify square parts on the conveyor belt using a camera-based system. The camera system takes images periodically to check for square parts. Initially, the goal is to detect whether a picture from a fixed camera position contains a square with acceptable accuracy. A further goal is to detect squares in pictures containing multiple objects.

## Data Collection

### Original Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, evenly distributed among four shapes. The data is consistent with basic specifications as shown in Table 2.1.

<div class="centered-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Image Details</th>
        <th>Shape</th>
        <th>Shape Area</th>
        <th>Shape Location</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>>3700 for each</td>
        <td>BG: White, Resolution: 200x200 pixels, Grayscale</td>
        <td>Square, Triangle, Star, Circle</td>
        <td>â‰ˆ25% of image size</td>
        <td>The whole shape should be in the frame.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Multiple Shape Image Data Generation

A new dataset was generated using 4-slots whiteboards, positioning different shape images from the original dataset randomly to ensure data diversity. The resulting images are resized to 200x200 pixels.

## Theory

The project employs image segmentation techniques, primarily using Hu moments from segmented images as primary features. A two-step process is applied: first, a two-class classification model for single shape detection, and then a multi-class classification for more complex images.

## Experiments and Results

### Two-Class Classifier Accuracy

The classifier was tested with varying portions of square and non-square images, yielding an average accuracy around 90%.

      <td>90%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Multi-Class Classifier Accuracy

The multi-class classifier showed varied accuracy across different trials, with an average around 80%.

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Classifier Accuracy</td>
        <td>81%</td>
        <td>81%</td>
        <td>79.5%</td>
        <td>78.15%</td>
        <td>82%</td>
        <td>77.3%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SK-learn Accuracy</td>
        <td>82%</td>
        <td>82%</td>
        <td>80%</td>
        <td>82%</td>
        <td>83%</td>
        <td>81.7%</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Conclusion & Improvements

The manufacturing plant's goal of identifying square parts was approached using a two-class classifier with high accuracy and a multi-class classifier. The two-class classifier performed well, while the multi-class classifier showed potential for improvement. Future work may involve mini batch learning and enhancing the gradient descent algorithm for better accuracy.
